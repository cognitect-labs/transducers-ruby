# transducers-ruby

[Transducers](http://clojure.org/transducers) are composable algorithmic transformations. They are independent from the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate aggregates.

Also see the introductory [blog post](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII).

## Installation

Until we release a Ruby gem:

    git clone https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-ruby.git
    cd transducers-ruby
    bundle
    rake install

# Usage

    require 'transducers'
    T = Transducers
    T.transduce(T.compose(T.map(:succ), T.filter(:even?)), :<<, [], 0..9)
    # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

See docs for more detail.
